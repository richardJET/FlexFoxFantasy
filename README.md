## About the league
The Flex Fox Fantasy Federation is not your average fantasy sports league. With a dedication to camaraderie and taking the game seriously, the league has thrived for over ten years. What started as a disparate collection of friend groups has evolved into a close-knit communit. Our league events, both virtual and in-person, foster friendships and rivalries alike, all in the spirit of good, fun and healthy competition. The blog is integral to platforming league content showcasing the camaraderie, humor, and dedication that define our community.
